## My process

After reading the requirements, I created the design in Adobe XD. Once my design was finallized, I created the file structure. After the file structure, I created the html skeleton. Once the skeleton was created, I added content and began styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Adobe XD

### What I learned

- BEM File Structure and naming convention
  - Learning this (although I'm still a little shaky with it) added the much needed organization structure and helped me create this page more efficiently than I've previously been able to.

### Challenges

- I'm not sure if this is related to the coding, but Google Chrome hiding the scroll bar really makes the page lack accessibility


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go-to resource for syntax and use examples
